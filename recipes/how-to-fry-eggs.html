        <h3>Description</h3>
        <h>Sunny side up eggs are eggs that are fried only on one side, leaving the yolk<br>
            runny and perfectly dippable. The key is to keep the yolk runny but set<br>
            the whites. Here's how:

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As many Eggs as you can eat</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><br>Heat a non-stick or a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat with 1<br>
                     tablespoon of cooking oil until the oil starts to shimmer. If using butter,<br> 
                     wait until it stops sizzling, but before it starts to turn brown.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><br>Add the egg to the skillet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><br>As soon as the whites have become slightly firm and the yolk begins to set,<br>
                    after about 2 minutes, use a large spatula to flip it, turning the egg gently,<br>
                    so the yolk doesn't break.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><br>Cook for 30 to 60 seconds more and serve with the flipped side up. Season<br>
                    with salt and pepper to taste.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
